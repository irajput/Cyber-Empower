  <p class="labelsf"> What is Cyber Empower?</p>
<p class="info">Cyber Empower is a week long summer programming camp for middle school students. We teach Python, a programming language that is essential to know due to its wide range of applications, as well as Java. Cyber Empower partners with the City of Palo Alto and TIBCO Software Company. TIBCO hosts Cyber Empower camps at their locations nationwide. We currently have locations in Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Denver. Our camp offers a fun and engaging curriculum for middle school students to keep them excited about coding and continue in the field of computer science. Camps often host guest speakers from TIBCO such as TIBCO Software Engineers who talk about how they got interested in computer science and how they use computer science everyday.
